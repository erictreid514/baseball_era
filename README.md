This repository contains data scraped from Baseball Reference. In baseball, a pitcher's success is measured by several key factors, and one of the most important of these factors is Earned Run Average or ERA. This takes the number of earned runs that a pitcher allows per 9 innings. A great ERA is one closer to zero. On basbeall reference, there was a page that contained the ERA values for the 500 best individual pitching seasons in baseball history. This repository contains two files: the first file contains the code that I used to scrape the data from baseball reference as well as the steps I took to clean the data, and the second file contains the dataframe that I created after scraping, importing, and cleaning the data.
